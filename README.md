# AI-HEDM-CPFE

A deep learning -based system to predict critical events (cracks, fatigue) in a strained polycrystal from synchrotron-based high-energy x-ray diffraction microscopy (HEDM) data.
The deep net is trained on simulated x-ray diffraction from synthetic polycrystalline samples that are evolved with a crystal plasticity finite element (CPFE) model.
The CPFE model was developed at Purdue University's [Advanced Computational Materials ](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~msangid/) lab.
The diffraction is simulated with the [MIDAS](https://github.com/marinerhemant/MIDAS) software suite developed at the Advanced Photon Source.
